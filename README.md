### GUN VIOLENCE DATA PROJECT

Hi Everyone, welcome to my first ever Repository!

# About me:
  - My name is Melissa and I am currently a rising fourth year at UC Berkeley from Oakland, California. I am majoring in psychology with a minor and data science, hence this project. Over the course of my college exeperience, my interest in data science has grown to new heights. Growing up in Oakland, I often experienced a lot of crime in my community, more specifically gun violence. In this project, I will analyze gun violence data to locate possible trends and implications for future data. 

# Description:
 - In this repository you will find a gun violence data set extracted from jamesqo/gun-violence-data. Attatched, will also be a code-file to my analysis of the data as well as my own interpretations of my findings. In my code file, I search for any possible trends or hotspots related to gun-violence. With the rise of mass shootings and questionable gun laws, this data is more important than ever. In this repository you will also find geo-maps and graphs represeting trends in the United States.
