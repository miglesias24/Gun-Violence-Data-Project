### Hi Everyone, welcome to my first ever Repository!

GUN VIOLENCE DATA PROJECT

About me:
  - My name is Melissa and I am currently a rising fourth year at UC Berkeley from Oakland, California. I am majoring in psychology with a minor and data science, hence this project. Over the course of my college exeperience, my interest in data science has grown to new heights. Growing up in Oakland, I often experienced a lot of crime in my community, more specifically gun violence. In this project, I will analyze gun violence data to locate possible trends and implications for future data. 

Description:
 - In this repository you will find a gun violence data set extracted from jamesqo/gun-violence-data. Attatched, will also be a code-file
